					I have worked in customer-facing roles for the last ten years, during which I have acquired the communication skills necessary to advise customers on suitable products, negotiate business contracts as well as handle recruiting, training and personnel matters. By organising promotional activities and conferences from beginning to end, I also became well versed in managing larger projects with many involved, as well as regulating my own workload and priorities.

				<p class="h4">
					In my final semester studies, I work part time as an Assistant Accountant for a company providing out of court divorce settlement advice. Since the business was about to close down, my day-to-day work was most about completing the accounting records and the tax return procedure. In additional, I performed various clerical tasks related to a few new customer accounts.

				<p class="h3">October 2003 - December 2010</p>
				<p class="h4">
					My role involved analysis of financial data to aid customers in choosing suitable investment plans. I also hosted internal and external conferences, conducted after-sales activities, assisted customers with insurance claims and dealt with customer complaints and feedback. During my time in this role I acquired a better understanding of accounting principles and theory, which led up to my decision to study the subject abroad.
				Key responsibilities included sales performance; providing sales skills training for team members; designing promotional activities; after-sales customer service.

					As a personal assistant I organised and prioritised the schedule for the CEO, making sure he attended to the most important issues and avoided time sinks. I also summarised reports, facilitated coordination between departments as well as attended meetings and working dinners with our suppliers, customers and government officers. In his absence I acted on behalf of the CEO in matters related to reporting and internal communication.

				<p class="h1">Murdoch University</p>
				<p class="h2">Master's Degree, Accounting</p>
				<p class="h3">2011 - 2013</p>
				<p class="h4">
					The master course covers fundamental theory and practice in accounting, including usage of accounting software. It also gives understanding of Australian business and taxation laws, as well as economical and financial theory. I think accounting is a practical discipline. Therefore, during my study time at the university, in addition to learning various accounting theories, I spent a lot of time on case studies and practicing accounting-related software including MYOB, Quickbooks and Excel. The units that particularly interested me were corporate accounting, management accounting and auditing, since these units provide a basis for how to analyse the operation of a business and improve it.
